## For this attemptscore is 0.63 for 100 test units

To test the code you have to unzip the data files and put them into a folder named "data".

Later run the file gpt.py and you will have two csv files: train.csv and test.csv

We used train.csv to fine tune gpt3 through openai API.
Some mistakes were made so the next step is to create a better dataset.
